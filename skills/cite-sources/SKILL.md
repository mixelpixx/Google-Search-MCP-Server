# Citation Generator

Generate citations in **$ARGUMENTS** format (default: APA if not specified).

## How to Use

After conducting research with `google_search`, `extract_webpage_content`, or `research_topic`, use this skill to format your sources as proper citations.

## Citation Formats

### APA 7th Edition (Default)

**Website/Online Article:**
```
Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). Title of page. Site Name. URL
```

**No author:**
```
Title of page. (Year, Month Day). Site Name. URL
```

**Online News Article:**

```

```

**No author:**

### Chicago 17th Edition

**Website (Notes-Bibliography):**
```
First Name Last Name, "Title of Page," Site Name, Month Day, Year, URL.
```

**Website (Author-Date):**

### IEEE

**Website:**
```
[#] A. Author. "Title of Page." Site Name. URL (accessed Month Day, Year).
```

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Source Information

For each source from your research, extract:
- Author(s) - check byline, about page
- Publication date - look for date published/updated
- Title - exact title of the page/article
- Site/Publication name - the website or publication
- URL - full URL

### Step 2: Handle Missing Information

**No author found:**
- Use organization name if official content
- Start with title if no clear author

**No date found:**
- Use (n.d.) for APA
- Use "n.d." for other formats

**Dynamic content:**
- Add "Retrieved [date]" or "accessed [date]"
