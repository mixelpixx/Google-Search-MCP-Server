# Fact-Check Workflow

Verify this claim: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Verification Process

### Step 1: Understand the Claim
Break down the claim into verifiable components:
- What specific facts are being asserted?
- What would need to be true for this claim to be accurate?
- Are there numbers, dates, or specific details to verify?

### Step 2: Search for Primary Sources
Use `google_search` to find:
1. **Official sources** - Government, academic institutions, official documentation
   ```
   query: "[claim keywords] site:gov OR site:edu"
   ```
2. **Fact-checking sites** - Snopes, PolitiFact, FactCheck.org
   ```
   query: "[claim] fact check"
   ```
3. **News sources** - Reuters, AP, established journalism
   ```
   query: "[claim]" with dateRestrict for recency
   ```

### Step 3: Extract and Compare
Use `extract_webpage_content` on top 3-5 sources with highest authority scores.

Compare:
- Do sources agree on the core facts?
- Are there important caveats or context missing from the original claim?
- What's the original source of the information?

### Step 4: Assess Source Quality
Prioritize sources by:
1. Primary sources (original data, studies, official records)
2. Academic/peer-reviewed content
3. Established news organizations
4. Expert commentary

Be skeptical of:
- Single-source claims
- Sources with commercial interest
- Outdated information
- Circular citations (all sources citing each other)
