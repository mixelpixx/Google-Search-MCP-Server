## Search Strategy

### Step 1: Recent News Search

Use `google_search` with date restrictions:

```json
{
  "query": "[subject]",
  "dateRestrict": "w1",  // Last week
  "num_results": 10
}
```

Then expand if needed:

- `"w1"` - Last week
- `"m1"` - Last month
- `"m3"` - Last quarter

### Step 2: Source-Specific Searches

For comprehensive coverage, search specific source types:

**Major News:**
```
"[subject]" site:reuters.com OR site:apnews.com
"[subject]" site:bbc.com OR site:nytimes.com
```

**Tech News (if applicable):**
```
"[subject]" site:techcrunch.com OR site:theverge.com
"[subject]" site:arstechnica.com OR site:wired.com
```

**Industry/Trade:**
```
"[subject]" announcement OR launch OR release
"[subject]" funding OR acquisition OR partnership
```

### Step 3: Extract Headlines and Summaries

Use `extract_webpage_content` on top 3-5 most relevant articles.

### Step 4: Identify Themes
