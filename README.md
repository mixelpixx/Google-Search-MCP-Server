# Google Research MCP Server

**Version 3.0.0** - Enhanced research synthesis with intelligent source quality assessment and deduplication.

An advanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive Google search capabilities, webpage content extraction, and AI-powered research synthesis. Built for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and other MCP-compatible clients.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Google API Status (Updated January 2026)

### 🚨 For New Users - API Closed

**Google has CLOSED the Custom Search JSON API to new customers as of 2024.**

**If you don't have a Google Custom Search API key already:**
- ❌ You CANNOT get one anymore
- ✅ See [ALTERNATIVES.md](ALTERNATIVES.md) for working solutions (SerpAPI, ScraperAPI, etc.)
- ✅ Existing users with API keys can continue using this tool

### ⚠️ For Existing Users - Important Limits

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 100 queries per day FREE
- After 100: $5 per 1,000 queries (max 10k/day)
- **This is usually why "not working" errors occur**

**Monitor Your Usage:**
- Dashboard: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard
- Enable billing: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing

**Sunset Date:**
- Google will retire this API on **January 1, 2027**
- Start planning migration to alternatives

### 💡 Quick Troubleshooting

**Error: "not working" or "403 Forbidden"**
1. Check if you hit the 100/day limit (wait until tomorrow or enable billing)
2. Verify API is enabled: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/customsearch.googleapis.com
3. Check your API key is correct in `.env`

**Error: "429 Too Many Requests"**
- You exceeded 100 queries/day
- Wait for midnight UTC reset OR enable billing

**Need more than 100/day?**
- Enable billing: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
- Cost: $5 per 1,000 queries

## Overview

This MCP server transforms Google search into a powerful research tool by:

- **Intelligent Source Ranking** - Automatically scores sources by authority, recency, and credibility
- **Deduplication** - Removes duplicate URLs and similar content across search results
- **Agent-Based Synthesis** - Leverages your existing Claude session to synthesize research findings
- **Focus Area Analysis** - Provides dedicated analysis for specific aspects of your research topic
- **Quality Metrics** - Tracks source diversity, authority, and content freshness

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Google Cloud Platform account with Custom Search API enabled
- Google Custom Search Engine ID

### Installation

#### Option 1: Using npx (Recommended)

Run directly without cloning:

```bash
# Set environment variables and run
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_id npx google-search-mcp
```

Or create a `.env` file in your working directory with your credentials, then run:

```bash
npx google-search-mcp
```

#### Option 2: Clone and Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <https://github.com/mixelpixx/Google-Search-MCP-Server>
cd Google-Research-MCP

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_custom_search_engine_id
```

**Note:** No Anthropic API key is required. The server uses agent-based synthesis that leverages your existing Claude session.

### Running the Server

```bash
# Start v3 server (recommended)
npm run start:v3

# For HTTP mode
npm run start:v3:http
```

Expected output:
```

| **intermediate** | 5 | Comprehensive analysis, 5-7 findings | Standard research tasks |
| **advanced** | 8-10 | In-depth analysis, 7-10 findings, contradictions | Decision-making, comprehensive reviews |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Research

```typescript
research_topic({
  topic: "WebAssembly performance optimization",
  depth: "basic"
})
```

Returns:
- 3 high-quality sources
- Brief overview (2-3 paragraphs)
- 3-5 key findings
- Quality metrics

### Comprehensive Research with Focus Areas

```typescript
research_topic({
  topic: "Kubernetes security",
  depth: "advanced",
  focus_areas: ["RBAC", "network policies", "pod security"],
  num_sources: 8
})
```

Returns:
- 8 authoritative sources
- In-depth executive summary
- 7-10 detailed findings
- Common themes across sources
- Dedicated analysis for each focus area
- Contradictions between sources
- Actionable recommendations
- Comprehensive quality metrics

### Targeted Search

```typescript
google_search({
  query: "docker container security best practices",
  num_results: 10,
  dateRestrict: "y1",  // Last year only
  site: "github.com"   // Limit to GitHub
})
```

Returns:
- Quality-scored results
- Duplicate removal report
- Source type classification
- Authority ratings

### Content Extraction

```typescript
extract_webpage_content({
  url: "https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/",
  format: "markdown",
  max_length: 5000,
  preview_length: 300
})
```

Returns:
- Clean extracted content
- Metadata (title, description, author)
- Word count and statistics
- Configurable preview
- Cache information

## Agent Mode

### How It Works

Agent Mode is the default synthesis method. Instead of requiring a separate Anthropic API key, it uses your existing Claude session:

1. **Research Gathering** - MCP server searches, deduplicates, and ranks sources
2. **Content Extraction** - Full content extracted from top sources
3. **Agent Prompt Generation** - All research data packaged into structured prompt
4. **Agent Launch** - Claude Code automatically launches agent with research data
5. **Synthesis** - Agent analyzes sources and generates comprehensive report

### Benefits

- **No Additional API Key** - Uses your existing Claude subscription
- **Full Context** - Agent has access to conversation history
- **Transparent Process** - See agent analysis in real-time
- **Same Quality** - Uses same Claude model you're already using

### Alternative: Direct API Mode

For automated workflows or scripts, you can use Direct API mode:

```bash
# .env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
USE_DIRECT_API=true
```

This bypasses agent mode and calls the Anthropic API directly from the MCP server.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Mode Not Working

**Symptoms:** Research returns basic concatenation instead of synthesis

**Solutions:**
1. Verify server shows "AGENT MODE" on startup
2. Check for `[AGENT_SYNTHESIS_REQUIRED]` in response
3. Ensure using v3: `npm run start:v3`
4. Rebuild: `npm run build`

### Quality Scores Missing

**Symptoms:** Search results don't show quality scores

**Solutions:**
1. Confirm running v3, not v2
2. Check server startup output
3. Verify no TypeScript compilation errors

### No Results Found

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Google API key is valid
2. Check Custom Search Engine ID
3. Ensure search engine has indexing enabled
4. Try broader search terms
